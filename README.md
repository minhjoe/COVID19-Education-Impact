# Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19 on Digital Learning  

This project analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student learning in the United States, with a focus on digital learning trends in 2020. The study examines how engagement with digital platforms relates to factors such as demographics, broadband access, and state/national policies, offering actionable insights to close the digital divide and improve equity in education.

## Context  

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted learning for more than 56 million U.S. students, exposing and amplifying inequities in educational access. As schools shifted to remote learning, digital platforms became vital for student engagement, yet many districts faced significant challenges related to broadband access, demographic disparities, and policy limitations.  

This project, inspired by LearnPlatform's mission to expand equitable access to education technology, seeks to uncover trends in digital learning and propose data-driven solutions to address educational inequities.

## Key findings:

- There was a positive correlation between the percentage of Black/Hispanic students and the proportion of students receiving free/low lunch prices.
- Google products were utilized the most throughout the pandemic, particularly Google Docs and Google Classroom due to their user-friendly interfaces.
- Although receiving assistance from the government and educational institutions, students, especially those from marginalized communities, were significantly affected in terms of their knowledge, mentality, and future earnings. Empathetic and constructive conversations are recommended to mitigate the impacts of this challenge.
